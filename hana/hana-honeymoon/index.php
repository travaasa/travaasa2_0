        <h1>One of Hawaii's Best Honeymoon Destinations</h1>
        <p>Adventure. Passion. Bliss.</p>
        <p>It all awaits you at Travaasa Hana.</p>
        <img class="shape circle right tmb tmb-01" src="/assets/images/honeymoon-hana-tmb-01.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Here in the secluded Hawaiian paradise of Hana, we believe honeymoons should be an intimate affair. So skip the crowds. Dodge the mainstream tourist traps. Start your adventure together amidst ocean breezes and tropical trees in your own private oasis on Hawaii’s coast. </p>
        <p class="blockquote small">It’s as if Hana was created just for the two of you.</p>
        <br class="clearfix">
        <p>Go on. Get your hands dirty. Rediscover each other. Make honeymoon magic.</p>
        <p>That’s what Travaasa Hana is all about.</p>
        <p>Time has a way of standing still at our inclusive resort, where the charm and romance of Hana dare you not to fall in love all over again. Even though you’re surrounded by one adventure after another, the grand scale of Hana’s natural beauty has a way of putting your mind at ease from the moment you arrive.</p>
        <p>It just doesn’t get any better than this.</p>
        <p>Your romantic rendezvous begins with an idyllic journey along the Road to Hana, one of the most breathtaking drives in all the world. Wander hand-in-hand through whimsical gardens. Make a splash in the waterfalls. Find a sandy beach to call your own. This pristine stretch of Maui’s coast is yours to discover.</p>
        <p>Your newlywed love nest at Travaasa Hana is a comfortable Sea Ranch Cottage, an authentic Hawaiian retreat surrounded by tropical landscapes – some even with views of the Pacific Ocean. There are no televisions, radios or clocks in this Never Never Land—and you won’t miss them. This is a sanctuary for pure elation and intimacy: no distractions allowed.</p>
        <p>And intimacy is yours to define during your heavenly honeymoon. Perhaps you’ll relax with a day of indulgence at The Spa at Travaasa Hana, where couple’s massages and locally inspired body treatments await. With your bodies, minds and spirits at ease, you can unwind with a soak in the spa’s lava-rock whirlpool, surrounded by nothing but lush tropical gardens and views of stunning Hana Bay.</p>
        <p>Or you can enjoy your couple’s massage in the privacy of your cottage before letting the last of your worries melt away in your private hot tub. As a blissful sense of newfound closeness washes over you, wander over to your private lanai. Let time stand still as you embrace and watch the waves roll over the crystal blue ocean before you.</p>
        <p>It's as if Hana was created just for the two of you.</p>
        <p>There's no rush to venture out from your cottage – in Hana, it feels as if you have all the time in the world. Should the time come to leave the love nest, though, you’ll find there is plenty to stimulate your senses. Explore Hawaiian culture together as you sway to a traditional hula or learn to strum the 'ukulele and serenade your sweetheart like a local. Take a lei making class and exchange beautiful hand-strung leis, or learn how to recreate the flavors of your honeymoon as our mixologists introduce you to The Art of the Cocktail.</p>
        <p>If a shared sense of adventure drew you together,  fall in love all over again at Travaasa. Indulge your thrill-seeking side by soaring over Maui’s long-dormant volcano in a glider, by taking in Hana’s untouched coastline on horseback as the Pacific waves display their might against ancient lava rock, or by embarking on a tour of picturesque Hana Bay in a traditional outrigger canoe.</p>
        <p>Experiencing intimacy with Hawaii's culture, natural surroundings and &mdash; most importantly &mdash; each other comes easily in Hana, where your heavenly honeymoon awaits.</p>
        <p>After all, this journey was made just for the two of you.</p>
