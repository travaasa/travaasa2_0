          <h1>Hana, Maui… as Authentic as Hawaii Gets</h1>
          <p>In Hana, Hawaiian culture is as important as breathing. Timeless local customs such as throw-net fishing and lei making are still a fundamental part of this community's fabric. At Travaasa, we're proud to be a member of such an extraordinary and tightly knit community.<br><br>
Geographically, Hana is bookended by spectacular tropical wilderness. To the north and west lies the serpentine Hana Highway (also known as the Road to Hana), where each bend of the journey reveals ravines draped in waterfalls and lush rainforest. To the south and west, the road continues and delivers travelers to the outskirts of Haleakala National Park, where Ohe'o Gulch tumbles to the ocean in a series of magnificent cascades and swimmable pools.<br><br>
Here at the eastern edge of Maui, you are completely removed from the ordinary, and yet completely involved in the moment. The magic of Heavenly Hana simply has to be experienced to be believed.</p>

            <h2>Ho'okipa (hospitality).<br>It's a Hawaiian way of life.</h2>
            <p>We are <em>'OHana</em>. Family.</p>
            <p>The minute you arrive at Travaasa Hana, you sense that you have been invited into someone's home. You receive a warm, casual, heartfelt greeting at our outdoor reception area.</p>
            <p>You'll be given a cool towel scented with lemon water to refresh you after your journey, and a traditional glass of <em>Pog</em> (guava, passionfruit and orange juice). This is genuine Hawaiian hospitality. A graciousness of times gone by. It's not scripted; it's natural. There is no training for this kind of hospitality. It is something every one of our team members, our <em>‘OHana</em> (family), grew up with.</p>
            <p>Our hospitality comes from living the Hawaiian lifestyle. And it shows. In fact, some of our repeat guests are charmed when they get invited to a family event at one our team member's homes. Our hospitality extends to everyday life. It doesn't stop after an eight-hour shift.</p>
            <p>This is the kind of genuine hospitality that can only come out of a place where there's no stoplight, no stop sign, no road rage and everyone waves to each other on the road with a truly natural smile. "Why be in a rush?" we ask. You are not rushed off to your room. You are not rushed off anywhere. There's no pressure here (so much so that you'll notice we don't have any clocks, TVs or radios in <a href="/hana/accomodations">your room</a>). We want you to stop and pass the time away in the Hawaiian tradition.</p>
            <p>It's something every single one of our team members grew up with.</p>
            <p>For Travaasa Hana, it's a tradition of hospitality, spanning more than 60 years.</p>

            <p>Your reception at the Travaasa Hana begins with a spectacular 49-mile drive along the coast, and ends with a Ti leaf lei in our lobby. Between point A and point B is one of the world's most amazing journeys.</p>
            <p>It's called the Hana Highway (or commonly known as the Road to Hana), and it is often referred to as one of the most scenic drives in America (visit <a href="http://ther2h.com" target="_blank"><strong>R2H</strong></a> to learn more).</p>
            <p>The road's serpentine course follows Maui's northeastern coast, skirting forested ravines and countless waterfalls. The drive takes anywhere from two to four hours, but we recommend you make it a half day. That's right. We invite you to not hurry to the Travaasa Hana. Take your time, savor the scenery, and embrace the journey. You'll be glad you did.</p>
            <p>The Hana Highway is a popular day trip for many visitors of Maui, but one of the biggest perks of being a Travaasa Hana guest is that you can truly savor the drive with no pressure to return to the other side of the isle by nightfall. In fact, many guests choose to drive here in the afternoon, when many drivers are heading in the opposite direction.</p>
            <p>Our vision at Travaasa has always been to uncover the magic of travel — the story of the journey. The road to the Travaasa Hana will give you stories to last a lifetime, even before your stay at our hotel.</p>

              <p>What started out as a "retirement project" evolved into the world-class destination that only a privileged few ever get to experience. But what really helped put Hana on the map (besides its unparalleled beauty) was a baseball team.</p>

              <p>The story begins just after the Second World War with Paul Fagan, an entrepreneur from San Francisco. He had investments in the area and wanted to retire here. However, jobs were scarce for the residents and the town's survival was seriously in doubt. Paul believed Hana held tremendous potential as a tourist destination. Together with his wife Helene, they designed a hotel for first-class travelers. This was an age when there was no such thing as a cut-rate tour, so luxury was the order of the day.</p>

              <p>In October 1946, the Ka''uiki Inn opened. Hawaiian press accounts hailed it as "the glamorous new resort on the Hana Coast." Paul knew he had to get the word out to the mainland. Being a majority owner of the Pacific Coast League''s San Francisco Seals, he knew the team needed a location for Spring Training in 1947. Since his team had just won the PCL Championship and set an attendance record, he "awarded" them with a trip to Hana. The team also brought along a cadre of sportswriters who wrote glowing reports about the inn and the area. One writer even coined the nickname still used today "Heavenly Hana."</p>

              <p>Their stories helped put Hana and the inn on the map. The inn eventually evolved into the Hotel Hana-Maui. Small and quietly isolated, Hana quickly became a world-class destination for travelers and celebrities looking to get away from it all. And while the hotel has expanded and changed hands several times over the decades, one principle will always guide us at Travaasa Hana. To keep "Heavenly Hana" Maui''s truly last Hawaiian place.</p>
