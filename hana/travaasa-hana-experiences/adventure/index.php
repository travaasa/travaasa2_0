SUP is similar to surfing except a paddle is used to maintain balance and movement on the water, providing a strong core workout that promotes general fitness in true Hawaiian style. Plus, SUP at Travaasa Hana is more than just a fun workout — it also provides beautiful views of the natural surroundings of Hana Bay.</p>
