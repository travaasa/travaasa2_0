          <h2>Hula</h2>
          <p class="description">The dance of hula can be enchanting — mesmerizing, even. Performers sway and move with a purposeful grace during this traditional Hawaiian ritual, a common sight at luaus around the islands. Hula is more than just a dance. It is something that links Hawaiians to ‘Aina (land), Kai (ocean) and, in broader terms, the story of life. That’s because every hula tells a story.  It was traditionally a way that stories and traditions were passed from generation to generation. Originally, hula was danced by men, but now it is performed by both men and women. Experience the enchantment of hula for yourself under the guidance of a kumu (teacher), who’s been practicing hula since childhood. Your kumu will teach you a story, and you'll learn all the graceful hand and foot movements that go along with telling it through hula.</p>

          <br />
          <h2>Lei Making</h2>
          <p class="description">You were probably charmed by the ti leaf lei adorned with plumeria blooms you received upon arrival, or maybe you're still wearing the kukui nut lei we gave you. It is through these leis that we welcome you to Travaasa Hana with the warm Spirit of Aloha.  You’ll soon discover that leis are traditionally used to celebrate all occasions in Hawaii. Celebrate your time in Hana by learning to make your own ti leaf lei, or string plumeria blooms for a colorful, wonderfully scented lei. We have a variety of classes where you can learn different techniques, including lei wili (twisting), lei hili (braiding), lei kui pololei (stringing with a needle) and more. No matter which technique you choose, our lei making experiences will allow you to take the Spirit of Aloha with you wherever your journey takes you.</p>

          <br />
          <h2>'Ukulele</h2>
          <p class="description">No other sounds embody the island spirit of Hawaii quite like the sounds of a 'ukulele. Just a few strums of a 'ukulele’s strings can transport you to a tranquil Maui shore, where you can almost feel the ocean breeze in your hair and a cool Mai Tai in hand. While the Portuguese only introduced the instrument to Hawaiians in the 19th century, the 'ukulele is now popularly known as a Hawaiian instrument. You'll learn basic chords, and before long, you'll be playing a well-known song. We'll send you home with sheet music and a little bit of history about the 'ukulele, and if you want to serenade friends and family at your next luau, you’ll find a  small 'ukulele for sale in our Noe Noe gift shop.<br /><br /></p>

          <br />
          <h2>Ecology</h2>
          <p class="description">The beauty and biodiversity of Hawaii is unlike anywhere else on Earth. The islands form the most remote archipelago on Earth, 2,500 miles from the nearest landmass. The native flora and fauna developed in isolation in the rich, volcanic soil, with new species occasionally arriving by accident via wind, water or wings. Early explorers also contributed, bringing plants and seeds endemic to their own culture. Today, the natural landscape of Hawaii remains one of the most incredible in the world, and as the land has largely been protected from overdevelopment, you can still experience Hawaii’s raw tropical glory firsthand. We invite you to learn more about Hawaii's ecological wonders and discover yet another reason why the islands are recognized the world over as the very definition of paradise.</p>

          <br />
          <h2>Hawaiian Throw Net</h2>
          <p class="description">Fishing in Hawaii looks a little different than fishing in other parts of the world, as poles and bait are replaced by long nets that are thrown into the ocean to catch many fish at once. The art of Hawaiian "throw net" has been passed on from generation to generation in Hawaii, and it’s easy to see why the sport’s handmade nets are becoming family heirlooms when you see the intricate interweaving of strands that goes into making one of these nets. You, intrepid traveler, will be learning how to throw a net into Hana Bay in the hopes of catching your very own fish or two, experiencing what native Hawaiians do everyday to catch dinner to share with their ‘OHana. You'll be surprised how easily you'll catch on to readying the net to cast, and how fun it is to throw a perfect net into the ocean, pull it in and discover what bounties the ocean has gifted to you.</p>

          <br />
          <h2>Talk Story</h2>
          <p class="description">The Hawaiian tradition of "talk story" is a cultural practice of information sharing, tradition building and reinforcement of a community's values passed from generation to generation. This nightly gathering around our fire pit allows you to get to know your fellow guests and the staff a little bit better. After all, this is a culture that knows how to sit together and talk. Sitting beneath the starry Hawaiian night sky and brought together by the warmth of the fire, we gather to talk about everything. The day. Life. Adventures. Memories. No two evenings are ever the same, whether it’s an evening of sharing stories or an impromptu 'ukulele jam. Sometimes, it’s comforting just to sit and listen to the crackle of the fire — after all, sharing the experience is just as powerful as sharing stories. No matter what course the evening takes, you can rest assured that every night is a little bit different and a whole lot of fun.</p>
