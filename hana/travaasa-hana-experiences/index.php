            <p class="description">If there was ever an ideal place for you to try juicing, it's Hawai'i. The rich and varied bounty of fruits and vegetables lets you whip up a nearly endless list of creations. But this isn't ‘old school' blending filled with chopping, slopping and mopping here. This is Juicing 2.0 Hana style. Together, we'll use whole foods to blend and mix fresh juices, soups, dips, spreads, desserts and salsas.</p>

So the bartender's trick is how best to combine juices, purees, fruits, spices and wonderful fresh ingredients to develop seductive new offerings and reinvigorate the classics we all know and love. Find out why the Mai Thai is synonymous with Hawaii. (Or is it?) The difference between a martini shaken or stirred. Discover what a muddle is and why you would use it. Join us as we embark on a tasting journey, learning how quintessential old-world recipes have morphed in search of the complex, layered flavors that create today's savory new trends.</p>

            <h5>Hula</h5>
            <p class="description">Every hula tells a story, and you'll learn all the graceful hand and foot movements that go along with telling it. Hula is more than just a dance—it is something that links Hawaiians to ‘Aina (land) and Kai (ocean) and in broader terms, to the story of life. Hula is traditionally a way that stories and traditions were passed from generation to generation. Originally, hula was danced by men, but now it is performed by both men and women. You'll learn a story from one of our cultural guides, your kumu (teacher) who's been practicing hula since childhood.</p>

Learn how to make your own Ti leaf lei, or string Plumeria blooms for a colorful, wonderfully scented lei. Leis are traditionally used to celebrate all occasions in Hawai'i, and we have a variety of classes where you can learn different techniques, from lei wili (twisting), lei hili (braiding), lei kui pololei (strung with a needle) and more.</p>

You'll learn basic chords, and before long, you'll be playing a well-known song. We'll send you home with sheet music, a little bit of history about the ‘Ukulele, and we even sell small ‘Ukulele in our Noe Noe gift shop—just in case you want to serenade family and friends at your next lū‘au.</p>

            <p class="description">Hawaiian "throw net" has been passed on from generation to generation in Hawai'i, and handmade nets are becoming family heirlooms (easy to see why when you see a handmade net and inspect the intricate interweaving of strands). You, intrepid traveler, will be learning how to throw a net into Hana Bay, in the hopes of catching a fish, but every day native Hawaiians throw net to catch dinner to share with their ‘OHana. You'll be surprised how easily you'll catch on to readying the net to cast, and how fun it is to throw a perfect net into the ocean, pull it in and discover…</p>

Join us for a fun bike excursion as we visit a handful of local sites while learning about land use, culture, history and stewardship. You'll become acquainted with Hana's sugar plantation days, under the diversity of plants, connect with the architecture, re-live festivals and get a closer look at local town life.</p>

            <p class="description">Some say creating artwork in a setting as beautiful as Hana's can be just as relaxing as a massage. That's why we offer you pressure-free ways to release your inner creative. You'll be inspired as you focus on the relation between your soul and your surroundings through your choice of artistic outlet.

            <h5>Ecology</h5>
            <p class="description">The beauty and biodiversity of Hawai'i is unlike anywhere else on Earth. The islands form the most remote archipelago on earth, 2,500 miles from the nearest land mass. The native flora and fauna developed in isolation in the rich, volcanic soil, with new species occasionally arriving by accident via wind, water or wings. Early explorers also contributed, bringing plants and seeds endemic to their own culture. We invite you to learn more about Hawaii's ecological wonders and discover yet another reason why it's recognized the world over as paradise.</p>

            <h5>Talk Story</h5>
            <p class="description">The Hawaiian tradition of "talk story" is a cultural practice of information sharing, tradition building and reinforcement of a community's values passed from generation to generation. This nightly gathering around our fire pit allows you to get to know your fellow guests and the staff a little bit better. After all, this is a culture that knows how to sit together and talk. Talk about everything. The day. Life. Adventures. Memories. No two evenings are ever the same, whether it's sharing stories or an impromptu ‘ukulele jam, or just listening to the crackle of the fire, every night will be a little bit different and a whole lot of fun.</p>

Our instructors bring years of training and knowledge, our yoga classes are varied and unique, and the location (outdoor or in our open-air Wellness Center) will reinvigorate you with its sheer beauty and calm. It's widely known that yoga is a wonderful technique to heal, detoxify and unify your mind and body. It can help fortify your awareness of movement, balance and intention, in addition to strengthening your body (through vinyasa yoga). No matter your age, strength or flexibility level, anyone can do yoga with the right attitude and the right teacher.</p>

            <h5>Coastal Walks</h5>
            <p>Start your morning with a coastal walk you'll remember for the rest of your life. Our guides will point out various native plants (as well as "canoe plants," plants that were brought to Hawai'i by the first Polynesians over 1,300 years ago to ensure their survival). You'll also see the picturesque ‘Alau Island, a bird sanctuary with an unbelievable grouping of wind-tossed palm trees at its summit. Many of our guides were raised in Hana, and will share their own personal mo‘olelo (stories) of growing up in this place of great beauty.</p>

            <h5>Coastal Workout</h5>
            <p class="description">Tired of exercising in a dark, enclosed gym that forces you to work out and then get in your cardio? Our coastal workout allows you to experience both at the same time as you walk along the stunning Pacific Ocean. You'll be carrying a sand-filled "pack" that intensifies your jog and serves as your resistance for a full-body workout. After you get done with this experience you'll be ready to grab a smoothie and relax by the infinity pool. </p>

            <p class="description">Start your day with a walk along the beautiful Maui coastline. You'll stop frequently along the way to take in breathtaking natural features as you wake your body for the day ahead. We'll teach you a non-static technique known active isolated stretching that helps improve circulation, increase the elasticity of muscle and fascia, develop joint range of motion and reduce stress.</p>

            <p class="description">One of the reasons you might be here is for a relaxing, stress-free, pressure-free Hawaiian experience. Of course, you may need some help releasing all the muscular tension civilization has placed squarely on your shoulders. We suggest foam rollers, a body rolling exercise that helps you release muscular tension with a rolling massage that feels great and helps increase flexibility. You'll also improve balance, core muscles, stability and total body function.</p>

            <p class="description">In this Travaasa, we help demystify the ancient practice of meditation—bringing awareness to our moment-to-moment experiences. This simple—but not easy—practice of acceptance, letting go, non-striving and suspension of the judgmental mind leaves us with a deep sense of openness and receptivity to ourselves, to others and to the moment as it unfolds.</p>
