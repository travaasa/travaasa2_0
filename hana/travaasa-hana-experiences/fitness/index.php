          <h2>Yoga for Mind and Body</h2>
          <p class="description">Yoga at Travaasa Hana is unlike yoga anywhere else in the world. Not only do our instructors bring years of training, knowledge and experience to our array of varied and unique yoga classes, but our outdoor practice area and open-air Wellness Center will reinvigorate you through their sheer beauty and calm. This tropical setting takes yoga to a deeper level as you connect with nature during your practice. It's widely known that yoga is a wonderful technique to heal, detoxify and unify your mind and body. It can help fortify your awareness of movement, balance and intention, while styles like vinyasa can also strengthen your body. No matter your age, strength or flexibility level, anyone can do yoga with the right attitude and the right teacher. Add a breathtaking backdrop like the palm-lined coastal town of Hana, and you’ll be amazed at what yoga can do for both your mind and your body.</p>

          <h2>Core Conditioning</h2>
          <p class="description">Mana is a divine spiritual power or energy. It's a power that comes from within, flowing through all of us and giving us the power to do what we believe we can do. So, it's no small wonder that our 30-minute core class will make you feel like you can conquer the world. You just have to believe. By harnessing and channeling your mana, you’ll tone your abs, lower back and glutes in this intense workout. You'll also improve core strength, balance and total body function using stability balls and gravity-resistant exercises. Your core muscles lay much of the groundwork for your body’s strength, flexibility and endurance, and this core conditioning class will show you how to unleash the true power that lies within you.</p>

          <h2>Pilates</h2>
          <p class="description">Maybe you’re here to stretch your horizons, or maybe you’re looking to stretch your imagination. While you’re at it, there’s one more thing you’ll want to stretch: your body, the vessel that allows all other parts of your Travaasa journey to be possible. The drop-dead gorgeous setting of our Wellness Center is the perfect place to stretch body, mind and soul alike, as floor-to-ceiling glass windows offer views of tropical beachfront surroundings as you strengthen and lengthen your body through Pilates. Pilates is designed to transform the way your body looks, feels and performs, building strength without excess bulk.

          <h2>Coastal Walks (original)</h2>
          <p class="description">Your morning sets the tone for the rest of your day, and when you’re spending the day in paradise, why not start your day by immersing yourself in the natural beauty of Hana? This experience kicks your morning off with a coastal walk you'll remember for the rest of your life. As your explore Maui’s coast, your guide will point out various native plants during your walk, including the famed "canoe plants” that were brought to Hawaii by the first Polynesians over 1,300 years ago to ensure their survival. You'll also see the picturesque ‘Alau Island, a bird sanctuary with an unbelievable grouping of wind-tossed palm trees at its summit. Many of our guides were raised in Hana and will share their own personal <em>mo‘olelo</em> (stories) of growing up in this place of great beauty.</p>

          <h2>Coastal Workout</h2>
          <p class="description">Tired of exercising in a dark, enclosed gym that forces you to work out and then get in your cardio? Our coastal workout allows you to experience both at the same time as you walk along the stunning Pacific Ocean.  After all, why work out inside a gym when you can have the sights and sounds of paradise as your fitness inspiration? You'll be carrying a sand-filled "pack" that intensifies your jog and serves as your resistance for a full-body workout, so you can get your strength training and cardio in at the same time. That means more time to enjoy Hana after your workout. After you get done with this experience, you'll be ready to grab a smoothie and relax by the infinity pool.</p>

          <br />
          <h2>Foam Rollers</h2>
          <p class="description">One of the reasons you might be here is for a relaxing, stress-free, pressure-free Hawaiian experience. Of course, you may need some help releasing all the muscular tension that civilization has placed squarely on your shoulders. We suggest foam rollers, a body rolling exercise that helps you release muscular tension with a rolling massage that feels great and helps increase flexibility. With targeted exercises that lay your body over these foam rollers, you’ll melt away aches and pain, leaving your body in tiptop shape for exploring all that Hana has to offer. You'll also improve balance, core muscles, stability and total body function. Foam rollers can also be used before or after a workout to relax your muscles.</p>
