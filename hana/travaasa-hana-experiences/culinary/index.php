          <h2>Healthy Regional Cuisine</h2>
          <p class="description">You won’t find dishes like those of modern Hawaiian cuisine anywhere else in the world. Here, Hawaii’s traditional foods meet with the many diverse ethnic flavors brought to the islands over a long and rich history of immigration, resulting in a local fusion with tastes of Japan, China and the Philippines, to name a few. The island is also a paradise for gourmets, with abundant fruits and vegetables grown from rich volcanic soil, a wide variety of high quality, fresh fish and locally sourced cattle. During this experience, you'll learn about Hawaii's many food staples and try your hand at some of our most revered local delicacies.</p>

          <h2>Juicing 2.0</h2>
          <p class="description">From boosting your immune and digestive systems to aiding in weight loss and detoxifying your body, there are many health benefits to juicing, and if there was ever an ideal place for you to try juicing, it's Hawaii. The rich and varied bounty of fruits and vegetables lets you whip up a nearly endless list of juicy creations. Travaasa Hana will guide you through this interactive experience so you get the most benefits out of your juice. But this isn't “old school” blending filled with chopping, slopping and mopping here. This is Juicing 2.0 Hana style. Together, we'll use whole foods to blend and mix fresh juices, soups, dips, spreads, desserts and salsas.</p>

          <h2>Coconut Husking</h2>
          <p class="description">Found across most of the tropics, the coconut, or niu, is known for its great versatility as seen in the many domestic, commercial, and industrial uses of its different parts. Recently, the health benefits of coconut water have made it a staple in health food stores around the country, while coconut oil is making a name for itself as both a cooking oil and a health and beauty product. Since ancient times, coconuts have been part of the daily diet of Hawaiian people. Witness the skill and tools involved in husking a coconut in traditional Hawaiian fashion, then enjoy fresh coconut water and meat as it's prepared.</p>
