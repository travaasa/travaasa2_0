        <h2>Healthy Regional Cuisine</h2>
        <p class="description">You won’t find flavors like those of modern Hawaiian cuisine anywhere else in the world. Here, Hawaii’s traditional foods meet with the many diverse ethnic flavors brought to the islands over a long and rich history of immigration, resulting in a local fusion with tastes of Japan, China and the Philippines, to name just a few. The island is also a paradise for gourmets, with abundant fruits and vegetables grown from rich volcanic soil, a wide variety of high quality, fresh fish and locally sourced cattle. During this experience, you'll learn about Hawaii's many food staples and try your hand at some of our most revered local dishes.</p>
