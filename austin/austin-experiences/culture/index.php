        <h2>Texas Two-Step</h2>
        <p class="description">As one of the country’s music capitals, you know Austin takes its dancing seriously — and you certainly can’t say you’ve experienced Texas until you’ve learned the quintessential local move: the Texas Two-Step. This partner dance includes three steps: a quick step, a quick step and then a slow step. It can be danced to music with either a 2/4 or 4/4 time signature. Perfect your style during this class, then show off your new dance moves at a local Austin dance hall or take a little Texas home to teach family and friends how to dance like a true Texan.</p>

        <h2>Ecology Series</h2>
        <p class="description">Hidden in the heart of Texas Hill Country, Travaasa Austin is also situated within 210 acres of the Balcones Canyonlands Preserve — a migratory landing spot for two federally endangered migratory species: the Black-capped Vireo and the Golden-cheeked Warbler. It’s also home to plants only native to the area. In this series, you’ll learn about native flora and fauna as well as the many healing properties of plants as you take guided walks into the forested hills and wilderness surrounding our Austin property. Be sure to bring your camera and keep your eyes peeled for rare birds. </p>

        <br />
        <h2>Learning Harmonica</h2>
        <p class="description">Pause to listen to the soulful melody of a harmonica and it’s not hard to imagine cowboys and ranch hands sitting around a campfire on a clear Texas night, swapping stories and singing songs under the stars. Not just for cowhands, the harmonica allows both the musically inclined and challenged to begin enjoying the benefits of music within just a few hours. You do not have to know how to read music to begin playing the harmonica. All you need is a tune in your head, because in some ways it is much like humming or whistling. In just a short time, everything clicks and it becomes as natural as whistling. You just sing your music through your harmonica without thinking about the numbered holes and whether you blow or draw. Learn how to play this local favorite like a true Texan during this hands-on experience.</p>

        <h2>Sketch & Draw</h2>
        <p class="description">It’s been said that within each of us is a creative being longing to get out. At Travaasa, we believe that. We offer pressure-free ways to release your inner creative and focus your soul by sketching and drawing in a therapeutic setting.  Let the serenity of Texas Hill Country act as your muse for the day. No experience or talent is needed to create something amazing that you can bring home as a reminder of your Travaasa journey. Simply grab a pencil and paper and let the artistic expression flow.</p>

A vision board is a simple yet powerful visualization tool that uses the universal law of attraction to begin manifesting your dreams into reality. This is an exercise in putting energy toward what you DO want in life, not what you don’t want. Put your dreams, goals and vision for the future on paper through this creative workshop, then channel the power of positive energy and see what happens. You might be surprised to see just how quickly your vision can manifest itself once you begin to believe in its reality.</p>

        <h2>Evening Fireside Chats</h2>
        <p class="description">At Travaasa Austin, we want to offer you a comforting and convivial way to end the evening. Find a seat around our firepit (outside) or fireside (inside) for a nightly gathering as fellow guests talk, laugh and share the day’s memories. It’s a friendly environment that allows you to get to know your fellow guests and the staff a little bit better. No two evenings are ever the same, whether it’s a night of sharing stories, roasting marshmallows or hosting an impromptu music jam. Sometimes, it’s comforting just to sit and listen to the crackle of the fire,  after all, sharing the experience is just as powerful as sharing stories. No matter what course the evening takes, you can rest assured that every night is a little bit different and a whole lot of fun.</p>
