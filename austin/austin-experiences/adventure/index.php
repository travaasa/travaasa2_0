      <h2>Prickly Pear Challenge Course</h2>
      <p class="description">Ever picked a prickly pear? If you have, you know the importance of each foot and hand placement as you find your way between the cactus needles. The same focus on movement is required as you navigate the space above the trees on our challenge course. Challenge your self-imposed limitations and overcome your fears as you navigate your way through our state-of-the-art course, which was designed in partnership with Outward Bound Professional and incorporates vertical climbing elements for a wide range of physical ability. At 35 feet in the air, you’ll discover your inner strength as you walk across the cables and telephone poles of our high ropes course. Begin at the Cob Web, then progress over Raider Bridge and through the Flying V to navigate Double Trouble. The linear progression of the course culminates with a fantastic reward: a 250-foot zipline flight soaring over the tree tops of Texas Hill Country.</p>

      <h2>Geocaching Adventure</h2>
      <p class="description">Geocaching, an outdoor sporting activity often described as a "game of high-tech hide and seek," involves the use of a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver or other navigational technique to hide and search out containers, called "geocaches," anywhere in the world. And in your case, you’ll have the entire spectacular Travaasa property to explore while discovering and hiding your own caches. See the trails in a new light as you search for these hidden geocaches, many of which feature Austin themes. Inside, you’ll find a log to sign to mark your accomplishment — and there may just be a few tiny rewards waiting for you in the geocaches, too.</p>
