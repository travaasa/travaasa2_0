      <h2>Yoga for Mind and Body</h2>
      <p class="description">Yoga is a wonderful technique to heal, detoxify and unify your mind and body. It can help fortify your awareness of movement, balance and intention, in addition to strengthening your body through styles like vinyasa yoga. No matter your age, strength or flexibility level, anyone can do yoga with the right attitude and the right teacher. If new to yoga, you’ll find a physical path that harmonizes the mind, body and soul. Yoga combines physical activity with breath to reduce stress, control weight, relieve lower back pain, and enhance focus. Our yoga classes include various styles and routines that create a dynamic, challenging program that combines strength, spirituality and a healthy dose of sweat. Connect with your body through physical movement, breathing techniques and intentions that allow you to be fully present with yourself as you practice with sweeping views that makes you feel as if you’re doing yoga in the treetops of Texas Hill Country.</p>

      <h2>Mechanical Bull Workout</h2>
      <p class="description">Ride ‘em, cowboy! You probably didn’t see this one coming, but you are in Austin. After you’ve gotten your muscles primed with Pilates or our core conditioning class, graduate to our mechanical bull for a core workout unlike anything you’ve ever experienced. This is a true Austin-style workout. Riding the mechanical bull is more than just a novelty at the local bar.  This fun workout will also help to increase your strength and improve your flexibility as you hang on while the bull continually moves up, down, right and left. By keeping you off balance, the bull forces you to use your leg muscles to grip its sides and core muscles to flex as you move forward and back. And lastly, form does count. Don’t forget to raise one arm up in the air to maintain balance, and you’ll get bonus points if you remember to wear your cowboy hat. Yee-haw!</p>

      <h2>Outdoor Circuit</h2>
      <p class="description">Spice up your workout routine with an outdoor circuit workout that’s sure to get your heart rate soaring. Circuit training is a refreshing exercise that provides excellent all-around fitness, tone and strength. Best of all, you get maximum results in a minimum amount of time, which means you’ll have more time to explore the myriad adventures that await you at Travaasa Austin. By mixing up the moves and changing the intensity throughout the workout, you’ll keep your body challenged and mind interested -- half the battle when you’re trying to motivate yourself to exercise. This workout takes you out of the gym and into Texas Hill Country, too, where you’ll work out among the trees and foliage that define this special part of Austin.</p>
