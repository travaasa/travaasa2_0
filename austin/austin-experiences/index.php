            <h5>Yoga for Mind and Body</h5>
            <p class="description">Yoga is a wonderful technique to heal, detoxify and unify your mind and body. It can help fortify your awareness of movement, balance and intention, in addition to strengthening your body (through vinyasa yoga). No matter your age, strength or flexibility level, anyone can do yoga with the right attitude and the right teacher. If new to yoga, you’ll find a physical path that harmonizes the mind, body and soul. Yoga combines physical activity with breath to reduce stress, control weight, relieve lower back pain, and enhance focus. Our yoga classes include various styles and routines that create a dynamic, challenging program that combines strength, spirituality and a healthy dose of sweat.</p>

            <p class="description">You probably didn’t see this one coming, but you are in Austin after all. After you’ve gotten your muscles primed with pilates or our core conditioning class, graduate to our mechanical bull for a core workout unlike anything you’ve ever experienced. Riding the bull will help to increase your strength and improve your flexibility as it continually moves up, down, right and left. By keeping you off balance, the bull forces you to use your leg muscles to grip its sides and core muscles to flex as you move forward and back. And lastly, form does count. Don’t forget to raise one arm up in the air to maintain  balance (bonus points if you have a cowboy hat).</p>

            <h5>Breath Work</h5>
            <p class="description">Who knew that focusing on something we do unconsciously all da long could do so much more for us? This class works with the breath, following its movements through the body. Restorative sequencing moves us slowly into a deep somatic experience to release stress and anxiety and bring about a calmer, more relaxed state (great for type-A personalities who have trouble relaxing). As we turn the lens inward, we will learn more about the asana, the breath and ourselves.</p>
