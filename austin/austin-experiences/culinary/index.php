        <p class="description">From detoxifying your body to providing you with a wealth of essential nutrients, there are many benefits to juicing. If you've ever given up on juicing due to the complicated prep and messy cleanup, this is the class for you. We bring you an interactive meal-making program focused on the use of a blender and fresh, whole food.  By the end, you’ll be amazed at just how easy juicing can be. This is a hands-on, experiential class that provides a novel way to discover the exciting possibilities of food. This is juicing Travaasa-style. And,  we don’t stop at creating flavorful juices. We use whole foods to blend  and mix into hot soups, ice cream, salsas, dips, spreads and desserts — all from scratch and all delicious.</p>
