        <h1>A Texas Honeymoon in Hill Country</h1>
        <p>It’s time to put the "do" in "I do."</p>
        <img class="shape circle right tmb tmb-01" src="/assets/images/honeymoon-austin-tmb-01.jpg" alt="">
        <p>And when you honeymoon amidst the ancient oaks, rolling hills and pristine wilderness of Travaasa Hill Country Resort in Austin, you can do your honeymoon your way.</p>
        <p class="blockquote small">At Travaasa Austin, you can honeymoon your way.</p>
        <br class="clearfix">
        <p>Our secluded, adults-only resort in Austin offers an inclusive experience that leaves you free to set the pace of your romantic rendezvous. Spend your days growing closer to one another as you share an itinerary filled with our resort’s signature experiences — from lavish spa treatments and wine tasting to horseback rides and relaxing by a fire. Enjoy uninterrupted Hill Country views from your room’s balcony or an intimate cabana at our stunning infinity pool.</p>
        <p>You might choose to start your romantic getaway with a more active and thrilling Travaasa experience, one that challenges both mind and body and leaves you a stronger team than ever before. Conquering the ropes and poles of our Prickly Pear Challenge Course 35 feet in the air, you’ll realize you can truly take on anything as a couple while you work together to overcome physical obstacles and mental fears. After mastering the course, you’ll be rewarded with a zipline ride overlooking the heights of the Hill Country.</p>
        <img src="/assets/images/honeymoon-couple-riding-1590-579.jpg" class="img-separator" alt="">
        <p>Or, explore the beauty of the area together in a more traditionally Texan manner — with a romantic horseback ride along the resort’s private trails through the nearby canyonlands, where you’ll ride through pristine hill country and cross a creek on horseback during your romantic rendezvous. Later, spend the afternoon on our secluded farm where our equine experts can teach you how to speak without words as you and your partner bond with our majestic animals – and each other.</p>
        <p>If the couple that cooks together stays together, get training for a lifetime of happiness as you discover new techniques and ingredients in our chef-led cooking classes. Bring your passion for one another to life in the kitchen as you learn how to nourish the one you love most.</p>
        <img class="shape circle right tmb tmb-02" src="/assets/images/honeymoon-austin-tmb-02.jpg" alt="">
        <p>And when it comes to nourishment during your Austin honeymoon, romance is always on the menu when you dine on our rustic Mesquite Patio. Here, the flavors of farm-to-table cuisine and fine wines are the perfect pairing for the sweeping views of the wooded hills of the Balcones Canyonlands Preserve.</p>
        <p>If you're looking for a slower pace for your heavenly honeymoon, the Spa at Travaasa Austin is calling. Relax in each other’s company with a couple’s massage before lounging the afternoon away at our infinity pool. Later, you can indulge in a dose of Zen and harmony as you share a yoga practice or join a guided meditation class.</p>
        <p>Or, simply bask in each other’s company as you wander the wooded wonderland that is Travaasa Austin. Lose yourselves to a leisurely stroll along the property’s whimsical tree-lined paths, and enjoy a quiet moment watching day turn into a star-filled night as the sun sets over Texas Hill Country.</p>
        <p>A stay at Travaasa is unforgettable – just like your honeymoon is meant to be.  </p>
        <p class="blockquote clearfix">After all, shouldn’t the beginning of the rest of your life together be simply unforgettable?</p>
