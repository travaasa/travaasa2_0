        <ul>
            <li>All weddings require a contract. The contract is between Travaasa and the Responsible Party</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="whatistheguestroomrequirementtohavemyweddingattravaasa">What is the guest room requirement to have my wedding at Travaasa?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Travaasa Events: In order to book a wedding and secure event space at Travaasa a minimum of 8 rooms each night or 15 cumulative room nights is required as part of your contract. Please keep in mind that Travaasa does not allow minors under the age of 16 on the grounds.</li>
            <li>Property Buy-Out: An exclusive buy-out of the property allows you and your guests’ exclusive use of the grounds. Site fees are still applicable. A buy-out requires a signed contract for all 70-guest rooms with a two night minimum stay (must include the night of the event). Children are permitted during the hours of the buy-out; beginning at 3 p.m. on the arrival date and ending at 12 p.m. on departure day. Minors are not allowed on property outside of those time periods. Buy-outs also require a Food &amp; Beverage Minimum Revenue and a Spa Minimum Revenue.</li>

The Venue Coordinator will assist in ensuring that you have met all of your contractual obligations to the hotel and offer suggestions on how best to utilize the venue.</li>
            <li>Travaasar equires that you work with a professional wedding planner to assist in planning your ceremony &amp; reception, facilitation of the ceremony rehearsal, finding outside vendors for needs beyond the inclusions of the hotel, and to orchestrate coordination the day of your ceremony and reception.</li>

Due to the make-up of the facility, not all venues within the property offer a rain backup at your selected site (i.e. The Farm). Any additional costs including tenting, outdoor flooring, umbrellas, heaters, etc. are at the discretion of The Wedding Couple and will incur additional costs. Travaasa requires a weather call a minumum of 6 hours prior to event start.</li>

Décor requiring additional set time (i.e. tenting- etc.) should be disclosed at least 2&#8211;3 months prior to your event date and is subject to availability and additional charges based on requirements.</li>
            <li>Please note that Travaasa does not handle set up of outside decor. All pick-ups must be made the night of the event unless alternative arrangements have been made in advance and approved by Travaasa. There is a $500.00 equipment handling fee per day for items not picked up as noted or if alternative date/time is not provided and/or approved in advance.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2 name="faq3">PARKING</h2>

        <h4 id="wherewillmyguestspark">Where will my guests park?</h4>

        <h4 id="whatisafoodandbeverageminimum">What is a Food and Beverage Minimum?</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>A Food and Beverage Minimum represents a minimum expenditure required for a specified reserved space. This minimum can be met through the purchase of food/menu items, liquor, beer, wine, and non-alcoholic beverages. The minimum does not include applicable tax or service charges nor does it represent the actual cost of your event. Actual costs are determined by your selection and/or consumption of all services for your event.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="isoutsidecateringallowed">Is outside catering allowed?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>As a full service event facility, outside catering is not permitted. All food &amp; beverage consumed in event space must be purchased through the hotel. The only exceptions to this rule are the wedding cakes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="canibringinmyownweddingcakeordesserts">Can I bring in my own wedding cake or desserts?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Yes! You are welcome to bring in your own wedding cake. However, please note that Travaasa cannot store wedding cakes and all deliveries must be made the day of the event. Travaasa recommends cake deliveries happen 2&#8211;3 hours prior to start of reception. Cakes should be delivered and assembled at final display location by cake vendor. We recommend cakes displayed in outdoor venues feature fondant icing in order to maintain integrity of cakes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="howcanifigureoutanaverageperpersoncostformyreception">How can I figure out an average per person cost for my reception?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The cost per person will be determined by the actual selections for your particular event. Until selections have been determined an average cannot be obtained.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="canyoucatertodietaryrestrictionssuchasveganglutenfreevegetarianetc.">Can you cater to dietary restrictions, such as vegan, gluten free, vegetarian, etc.?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Yes! Travaasa focuses on healthy Farm-to-Fork dining. Our Executive Chef has created a number of options that can accommodate special dietary needs. Please discuss with your Venue Coordinator any details of dietary needs so that advance arrangements can be made to accommodate your guests.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="willtherebeatastingbeforetheeventdate">Will there be a tasting before the event date?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Yes! As part of our Travaasa Wedding Events a tasting will be offered once your contract has been signed and menu options selected. We recommend scheduling your tasting 2&#8211;3 months prior to your wedding reception.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="doyouchargeacorkagefee">Do you charge a corkage fee?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Travaasa does not allow outside wine to be served in our event spaces. However, if the Wedding Couple have a special bottle that Travaasa is unable to obtain, we will allow a maximum of (3) bottles to be brought in with a $25.00 corkage fee per bottle.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="whyaremymenuandbarpricessomuchhigherthanifiworkdirectlywithacatererorbuymyownalcohol">Why are my menu and bar prices so much higher than if I work directly with a caterer or buy my own alcohol?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>As a full service event facility we try to offer the simplest pricing structure possible. In doing so we provide pricing for food and beverages that are inclusive of the equipment necessary to deliver those services. For example, Travaasa will not charge a separate rental fee for tables, chairs, china, silver, or glassware required to deliver your menu (a caterer will offer pricing for just food with additional rental prices noted for the equipment.)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="amirequiredtotipontopoftheservicechargewhyareservicechargestaxed">Am I required to tip on top of the service charge? Why are service charges taxed?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Additional gratuity is not required above the contracted 22% service charge. In the state of Texas, contracted service fees are different than optional “tips” or gratuities and are therefore subject to taxation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 name="faq5">SPA</h2>
        <h4 id="istherearequirementtohavespaservices">Is there a requirement to have spa services?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Buy-Outs require a Spa Revenue Minimum, which is determined by the time of year and day of the week. Spa Revenue Minimum’s can be met by booking appointments. Should the actualized spa revenue fall below the Minimum the Responsible Party will be responsible for the difference.</li>
            <li>Non Buy-Out’s are not required to book spa treatments at the spa. Keep in mind that the Travaasa Austin Spa is open to the public and takes appointments from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily. The spa is also located at the pool deck and the pool must be made available to spa day guests. In order to use the pool exclusively it is required to buy-out the spa during the time you wish to use the space.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="doservicesacquiredbymyguestscounttowardstheminimumrequirement">Do services acquired by my guests count towards the minimum requirement?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Spa services acquired by guests can be applied towards any contracted spa minimum as long as the services are rendered during the contracted event period. Spa revenue cannot be applied towards other commitments such as food &amp; beverage minimums or room rental commitments.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="whathappensifsomeonecancelstheirspaorno-showsfortheirappointment">What happens if someone cancels or no-shows for their spa appointment?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>If a guest cancels no-shows their spa appointment, the charges for the spa appointment will be charged to the Responsible Party unless the individual provided a form of payment at the time of booking the appointment. Travaasa can advise guests of the cancellation policy at the time of booking their appointments and obtain a form of payment if guests call in to make their own reservations.</li>
