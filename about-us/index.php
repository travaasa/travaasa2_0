          <h1>The Travaasa Vision</h1>
          <p>Our inspiration for Travaasa began with our own travel&#151;far too often we stayed in cold, soulless concrete towers that supressed the magic of a destination. For years, we searched for an experiential hotel that truly embodied a sense of place&#151;its culture, its cuisine, its adventures, its sense of well-being. We wanted somewhere that would reawaken us, intellectually, culturally and experientially; a place where we could learn, touch and do new things; a place we couldn’t find in our own backyard, or at the local spa or gym. In other words, we wanted the joy of the journey along with the magic of arriving somewhere new and instantly getting a sense of that place. We wanted spontaneous moments and the magic of surprise that travel is supposed to bring us, all embodied in a hotel with wonderful amenities.<br><br>
<strong>No such place existed, so we decided to create it.</strong><br><br>
We are more than just destination hotels with world-class spa services, cuisine inspired by local flavor and breathtaking vistas. Our hotels recapture the magic of travel and give you indelible memories. Travaasa Experiential Resorts embody the best of what happens when you travel: the journey and the discovery of a place, people, yourself and the stories that will define your life. <strong>We invite you to join us on the journey.</strong></p>

        <p class="description">Your Travaasa starts the moment you find yourself in a car, winding down a spectacular Texas Hill Country road. The vista unravels like a color-saturated ribbon, leading you to a place unlike any other. The car stops. You have arrived. And what you'll find is an intimate gathering of buildings — a curated amount of lodges. We’re about your experience, your travel – not catering to hundreds of people. <a href="/austin">Travaasa Austin</a></p>

        <p class="description">Travaasa Hana is a destination resort unlike anywhere else in the world. Gracious in every sense of the word, from our staff to accommodations, dining, experiences, scenery and much more. We invite you to discover it for yourself. <a href="/hana">Travaasa Hana</a></p>
