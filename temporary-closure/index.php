          <h1>COVID-19 Travel Update</h1>
          <p>Out of an abundance of caution and for the safety and wellbeing of our guests, employees and tight-knit Hana community, Travaasa Hana has made the difficult decision to temporarily suspend operations effective March 26 due to the ever-evolving global COVID-19 pandemic. While there continues to be no confirmed cases of COVID-19 at Travaasa Hana, we will not be accepting any incoming guests beginning March 24, 2020 and will be reaching out to our guests to reschedule any existing reservations through May 1, 2020. </p>
          <p>We sincerely apologize for any disruption to travel plans this may cause.  Our front desk and reservations teams are available 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. HST to answer any questions and assist with current reservations. You may reach them at <a href="tel:8668962679" target="_blank">1-866-896-2679</a>. We thank you for your patience during this time.</p>
          <p>At Travaasa Hana, we feel it is our responsibility to do our part in mitigating the spread of COVID-19. In accordance with the State of Hawaii, Governor David Ige and Maui County Mayor Michael Victorino’s directives which include the closure of the Hana Highway, as well as the guidance provided by the Hawaii Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), we continue to take precautionary measures to help keep everyone safe. </p>
          <p>Visitors can also get the latest travel updates on COVID-19 in Hawaii at <a href="https://www.gohawaii.com/special-alerts-information" target="_blank">https://www.gohawaii.com/special-alerts-information</a>.</p>
          <p>Mahalo for your understanding and cooperation in these uncertain times. We are all in this together and hope to welcome you to Travaasa Hana at a later time.</p>
          <p>From our ʻohana to yours,</p>
