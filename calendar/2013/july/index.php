                <h6>Tai Chi Joy <span class="disclaimer">– <a href="/austin">Austin</a></span></h6>
                <p>Tai Chi is a joyful practice that empowers our energy centers. It is also described as "meditation in motion" and helps us to nurture our body as we gather energy and calm our mind. The Tai Chi forms (or postures) are done in a relaxed, artful and linked way, with the circular and rhythmic movements of one position flowing seamlessly into the next. The five essential qualities of Tai Chi are: slowness to develop awareness, lightness to make movements flow, balance to prevent body strain, calmness to maintain continuity and clarity to focus the mind. Some claim that Tai Chi helps with various health conditions and has both physical and mental benefits.</p>

It is also important to note that certain areas in the foot, when stimulated, will affect certain organs. This class will help to improve mobility, strength, power and general health.</p>
